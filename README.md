A core library of R.dart which is generated by [Flr(Flutter-R)](https://github.com/YK-Unit/Flr) in flutter project.

## dependency relationship table

Because the Flutter SDK is currently in an unstable state, so I create the following dependency relationship table for developer to select the correct version of `r_dart_library` based on the relationship table and the Flutter SDK version of Flutter project.

由于Flutter SDK目前处于不稳定的状态，所以我创建了下面这个依赖版本关系表，让开发者根据这个关系表和Flutter项目的Flutter SDK版本选择`r_dart_library`的正确版本。

| r_dart_library version | requires Flutter SDK version |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0.1.0                  | <1.10.15                     |
| 0.2.0                  | >=1.10.15                    |
